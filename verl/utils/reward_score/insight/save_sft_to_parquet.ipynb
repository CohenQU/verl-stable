Recently, different methods have been proposed to derive an\\nenergy value out of the logits of a classifier for out-of-distribution (OOD) detec-\\ntion or OOD generalization. However, these methods mainly focus on the energy\\ndifference between in-distribution and OOD data samples, neglecting the energy\\ndifference among in-distribution data samples. In this paper, we show that the en-\\nergy among in-distribution data also requires attention. We propose to investigate\\nthe energy difference between in-distribution data samples. Both empirically and\\ntheoretically, we show that previous methods for subpopulation shift (e.g., long-\\ntail classification) such as data re-weighting and margin control apply implicit\\nenergy regularization and we provide a unified framework from the energy per-\\nspective. With the influence function, we further extend the energy regularization\\nframework to OOD generalization scenarios where the distribution shift is more\\nimplicit compared to the long-tail recognition scenario.
